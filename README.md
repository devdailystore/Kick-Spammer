## 📋 Description

This Go application demonstrates multi-threaded HTTP requests using proxies and authentication tokens. It showcases:

- **Concurrent Workers**: Multiple goroutines sending requests simultaneously
- **Proxy Rotation**: Random proxy selection from a pool
- **Token Management**: Authentication token handling
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and retry logic
- **API Integration**: HTTP client implementation for REST APIs

## 🛠️ Technical Features

- **Language**: Go
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines and WaitGroups
- **Networking**: HTTP client with proxy support
- **File I/O**: Reading configuration from text files
- **Random Selection**: Proxy and token rotation

```

## 🔧 Setup (Educational Only)

1. **Install Go** (version 1.21 or higher)
2. **Clone the repository**
3. **Configure data files**:
   - Add proxy list to `data/proxies.txt` (format: `ip:port`)
   - Add tokens to `data/accs.txt` (one per line)

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By studying this code, you can learn about:

- **Go Concurrency**: How to use goroutines and sync.WaitGroup
- **HTTP Clients**: Creating and configuring HTTP requests
- **Proxy Usage**: Implementing proxy rotation in HTTP clients
- **Error Handling**: Managing network errors and retries
- **File Operations**: Reading configuration from files
- **API Authentication**: Bearer token implementation

## 🔍 Code Analysis

### Main Components:

1. **Worker Function**: Demonstrates goroutine-based concurrent processing
2. **HTTP Handler**: Shows proper HTTP client configuration with proxies
